# 🎬 Section-by-Section Animation & Transition Plan

---

## **1. Hero (Landing)**

**Current:** Static text with looping wave background.
**Target:** A cinematic “entry scene” that sets the tone.

* **Entry animation (on page load):**

  * *CREATIVE CODER* letters stagger in (one by one, sliding upward).
  * Subline *Art | Code | Innovation* fades in after the title.
  * Wave background rises gently from the bottom (parallax depth).

* **Exit animation (on scroll):**

  * Title scales slightly up, then fades out.
  * Wave lowers down, blending into About section.
  * Scroll indicator fades out.

**Transition goal:** Feels like the wave *hands off* the user into the next section.

---

## **2. About (Philosophy / Manifesto)**

**Current:** Simple static text.
**Target:** Bold, oversized manifesto text like scene captions.

* **Entry animation:**

  * Lines of text (“Code is not just logic. It’s art.”) fade in sequentially as you scroll.
  * Each line slides in from alternating sides (left/right).
  * Background shifts: subtle gradient fade to differentiate from Hero.

* **Exit animation:**

  * Last line grows bigger (fills screen) then dissolves → morphs into Gallery headline.

**Transition goal:** Reads like a *chapter title in a movie*, connecting Hero to Gallery.

---

## **3. Gallery (Work Showcase)**

**Current:** Grid of images/cards, static.
**Target:** Dynamic reveal that feels like uncovering creative experiments.

* **Entry animation:**

  * Gallery headline expands from center.
  * Grid tiles fade/slide in with stagger (like a wave of images).
  * Hover: each tile tilts slightly, glowing edges or glitchy highlight.

* **Scroll-driven parallax:**

  * Background waves slow down relative to tiles → depth effect.

* **Exit animation:**

  * Grid tiles collapse inward → shrink into Blog title.

**Transition goal:** Feels like the Gallery *folds away* into the Blog section.

---

## **4. Blog (Thoughts & Experiments)**

**Current:** Blog cards simply appear.
**Target:** Cinematic title-driven entrance, storytelling emphasis.

* **Entry animation:**

  * Section starts with a fullscreen bold word: *IDEAS*.
  * Word fades/scales down → becomes “Blog”.
  * Blog cards slide upward into place.

* **Scroll-driven interaction:**

  * As you scroll, cards subtly drift (parallax layers).
  * Background lines (like digital noise or waves) animate slowly.

* **Exit animation:**

  * Cards fade/slide out.
  * “Projects” word fades in big → morphs into next section header.

**Transition goal:** Blog feels like “thinking in motion” → naturally shifts into “building (Projects)”.

---

## **5. Projects (Case Studies / Builds)**

**Current:** Flat list/grid.
**Target:** Narrative-driven, almost like a slideshow embedded in scroll.

* **Entry animation:**

  * “Projects” title reveals letter by letter.
  * First project image zooms into focus from background.

* **Scroll-driven showcase:**

  * Each project is revealed horizontally as you scroll vertically (scroll hijack → horizontal slide).
  * Text (description) slides in from one side, image from the other.

* **Exit animation:**

  * Last project zooms out → transforms into Contact section background.

**Transition goal:** Projects feel immersive, almost like flipping through *chapters of a portfolio book*.

---

## **6. Contact (Final Call-to-Action)**

**Current:** Standard form.
**Target:** Cinematic closing statement, echoing Hero.

* **Entry animation:**

  * Bold message fades in letter by letter: *“Let’s Build Something Together.”*
  * Waves return in background (tying back to Hero).
  * Contact form fields slide up gently with slight delay.

* **Microinteraction polish:**

  * Form inputs glow subtly when focused.
  * Send button pulses slightly on hover.

* **Exit / footer animation:**

  * Waves recede slowly, logo animates as “end card” of the journey.

**Transition goal:** Feels like the site “loops back” to the Hero vibe, closing the circle.

# 🌊 Animation Narrative Flow (Macro-Level)

1. **Hero → About:** Title fades out, manifesto lines fade in → smooth narrative shift.
2. **About → Gallery:** Last manifesto line expands and dissolves → Gallery unfolds.
3. **Gallery → Blog:** Grid tiles collapse inward → Blog word fills screen.
4. **Blog → Projects:** Blog cards fade → Projects slide horizontally, cinematic.
5. **Projects → Contact:** Last project zooms out → Contact section emerges, waves return.

# 🎯 Principles to Match *Won J You’s* Style

* **Bold typography as cinematic anchor** (oversized text reveals).
* **Scroll = story** (entry + exit animations for each section).
* **Parallax depth** (background vs. midground vs. text layers).
* **Microinteractions** (hover effects, glowing links, responsive nav).
* **Consistency in motion language** (every section uses stagger, fade, parallax, but in its own unique rhythm).
